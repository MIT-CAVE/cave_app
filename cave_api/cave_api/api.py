# Write any code here to create an execute_command function
# This will serve as the api execution entry point for your app
# This can be directly defined in this file or imported from another file
# Example execute_command functions can be found in cave_api/cave_api/examples

# By default we show a special meta execute_command function that allows you to select any of the examples to view
# This is not a great example for how you should code, but rather offers an easy way to view all of our examples in one place
# To view the code for an example, open the corresponding file in cave_api/cave_api/examples
# If you want to manually change the example that is loaded, you can change `example_selector` below to any of the other examples
